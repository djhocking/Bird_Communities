# Abundance Model Accounting for Detection and Availability from Bird Point Counts

## General description

Point counts at ~79 sites with most visited on two occasions in 2015 and 2 additional occasions in 2016 (4 closed periods for an open population model). At each visit, three time bins of 3 min, 2 min, and 5 min were used with only new birds recorded in each bin. Birds were counted in three distance bins of approximately 50, 100, and 150 m. 

## Use
